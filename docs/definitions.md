# Definitions

## Hyperclick

definition, or trigger the `hyperclick:confirm-cursor` command.

## Service API

Atom IDE UI consumes an abstract "definitions" API to fetch definitions at
arbitrary editor positions. Hyperclick and Definition Preview are automatically
provided behind the scenes.

Although it may make sense to use the Hyperclick API directly, for many
use cases it's best to provide definitions and let Atom IDE UI handle the rest.
